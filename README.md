# Semi-Vim Shortcuts for VS Code

This simple extension enables some basic movement shortcuts of Vim in your VS Code environment.

Hopefully, nothing would change with your existing shortcuts. Anyway, you can always disable the extension using the Extensions view (`ctrl`+`shift`+`X`).

## Shortcuts

| Delete next            | `del`       | `ctrl` `cmd` `shift` `space` |

üëç You can also use these shortcuts on file explorer, sidebar lists/trees (e.g., find in files or source control,) auto-completion lists and breadcrumbs.

üëç Hold `shift` and/or `alt` keys with these shortcuts to select text or move by word.

üëç Hold `alt` keys with delete next/previous shortcuts to delete by word.

üëç To use shortcuts on the command palette lists, you need to first press `tab` key to focus on the list.
